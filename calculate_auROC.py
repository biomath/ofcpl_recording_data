    Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (auROC) calculation

        neuron. r1 and r2 correspond to two example 100-ms bins. b, Average firing rate of this neuron. c, Area
        under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) for r1, in which the neuron increased its firing
        rate relative to baseline. We compared the histogram of spike counts during the baseline period (dashed
        line) to that during a given bin (solid line) by moving a criterion from zero to the maximum firing rate (in
        this example, 68 spikes/s). We then plotted the probability that the activity during r1 was greater than the
        criteria against the probability that the baseline activity was greater than the criteria. The area under this
        curve quantifies the degree of overlap between the two spike count distributions (i.e., the discriminability
        of the two).
